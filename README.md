# project0

In this project I made a personal webpage about myself.
This project contains four html pages:
1. index.html:
  This is the homepage of my webpage. In here, the other three pages are briefly desribed. Whith each description there is a button which makes it easier to navigate.
2. about.html:
  In here there are a few things described about myself. This contains who I am, where I am from, what I am doing and some projects I made.
3. resources.html:
  This page contains the resources I learned coding from, to give you an idea of what I've learnt so far and where I learned it from.
4. contact.html:
  This shows the platforms you can contact me on, including links to my github and linkedin.
  
Within the four html pages there is also a navbar so you can easily navigate to other pages from wherever you are.
